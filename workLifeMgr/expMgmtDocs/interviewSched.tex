1.To make sure we have one record for you in our system, please
confirm your legal name.

\textit{My legal name is Vivek Kale}. 

2. What dates and times are you available for your technical phone
interview (45 minutes in length) over the next 3 weeks? We hold
interviews between 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM Pacific Time, Monday through
Friday. Please let me know if you'll need any special accommodations
for your interview. If you're able to give several dates and times it
would be greatly appreciated.

 3. What is the best telephone number for your technical phone
 interview? 4. What time zone will you be in for your interview? (Just
 in case people are traveling, I like to ask.)

 5. What coding language(s) are you most comfortable with?

6. Do you have any urgent offer deadlines or other interviews
scheduled? 7. Do you know any full-time Googlers? (working in any
location) 8. Will you require work authorization and sponsorship to
work in the U.S.? 9. If all goes well and you get your Google offer
(that’s the goal!) what month do you anticipate to start? 10. Are
there any technical skills, experiences or interests not on your
resume that you would like to highlight? 





\textbf{Summary:} {\small This is the weekly planning document, which includes 
the month planning document just before it. 
To create this, first look at weekly routines and make sure they are here. Then,
look at the yearWeekPlan doc, along with the project plan doc and iPhone
todo list, and divide tasks across days of the week. Finally, put this
into the schedule. 

After this is done, these items should be checked in the work and
work+life calendar, and verified through email. 
Then, they should be put in the work + life
calendars.

Finally, at the beginning of each day, the todos should be refined,
well-defined, and grouped, within each calendar day. Then, these todos
should be assigned deadline, timeEst, and priority. 

With this, we must get out the project sheets, and write in more todos
while we work on it.
