\tiny \2 {\tiny Opening: History:  Advisor , MPI.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny My Work aims to solve scheduling problem with
  low-overhead.} 
%\tiny \2 {\tiny The key question I want to answer is how I can make a 
%long-term impact based on the thesis work I have tried to solve. } 

\tiny \2 {\tiny The conference can help me in 3 ways to accomplish this goal. }
\tiny \2 {\tiny Long-term Goal: Using my PhD thesis as the basis, 
provide new insight or develop an exemplar technology in the area of
computer science and mathematics.}
 % Don't say that the
% conference is the event that shapes
% your life. 

\tiny \1 {\tiny First, helps to strengthen work within my area of
  specialization.}
%\tiny \2 {\tiny Teach others what I am doing , who come from different
%areas of mathematics and computer science.} 
%\tiny {\2 This process can help to increase awareness in other 
%disciplines of my work, not just in the area of my speciality.} 

\tiny \2 {\tiny Explaining my work to experts in a variety of 
disciplines in computer science, my hope is to 
define and formulating the problem in ways done in another area of computer
science, e.g., Algorithms or Theoretical Computer Science, or 
in areas of Mathematics.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny Particularly new mathematical formulations of the work can
  fill gaps in the work, and make the work stronger.}  

% the dissertation.}
%can help to provide additional insights of the work.} 
%\tiny \2 {\tiny Shed light on how to further strengthen the work.}
%\tiny \2 {\tiny It can also involve describing different aspects of my
%  solution. For example, software engineering aspect less
%  emphasized. Formalization through Theory of Computation could allow 
%for better runtime software, and increased error correctness of the solution, and to identify new techniques.}
%\tiny \2 {\tiny Teach others what I'm doing.} 

\tiny \1 {\tiny Impact to other areas of computer science and
  mathematics.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny Could my work provide insight to new solutions in other areas such as
distributed systems? Could my scheduling techniques be beneficial
here? The opportunity to talk to others in distributed systems would
be beneficial.}

\tiny \1 {\tiny  Variety of backgrounds in computer science, and not
  just a specific field, it can help me understand implications of my
  thesis in areas other than computer science.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny Architectures: Fast Hardware Synchronization. }  
\tiny \2  {\tiny Distributing Systems: Cloud computing .} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny Algorithms: Formulate as a theoretical problem. } 
\tiny \1 {\tiny It would benefit helping me develop long-term goals
  by having continued impact that my field ideas can have on society
  for years to come.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny Because of the laureates continued involvement in the
  research community, they are uniquely aware of the current problems
  in society, and have a perspective on what can shape the next
  generation.}
\tiny \2 {\tiny How does my thesis work even when you consider new advances in physics, where quantum computing can change my thesis?} 

\tiny \1 {\tiny Forum can help teach how handle life.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny The way you handle your life can make a difference in what changes you make.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny Conferences are the norm, rather journals.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny  A forum like this can help teach me how to remain competitive in this field without breaking down.} 
\tiny \1 {\tiny Conclusions:}
\tiny \2 {\tiny Getting other expertsâ€™ opinions will allow one to formulate a
particularly well-rounded opinion and vision for where I want to go.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny This forum would help me shape my longer-term views, goals and
ideas of how to succeed in my career.} 
\tiny \2 {\tiny I believe that coming to a forum with other people 
  provides an opportunity for me to define my career goals, something
  I would like to be focused on as I work to complete my PhD.}

%I also believe that by sharing my work with others and
%listening to others work, I can become more knowledgeable in my
%field.

\tiny \2 {\tiny Intent of Letter. }

\tiny \2 {\tiny Knowledge of Vivek and relationship to Vivek } 

\tiny \2 {\tiny My credentials, and who I've worked with.} 

\tiny \1 {\tiny Problem definition} 

\tiny \2 {\tiny Just doing MPI+OpenMP process/thread not good enough} 

\tiny \2 {\tiny Additionally, load imbalance problem across cores.} 

\tiny \2 {\tiny Bulk-synchrony needed for applications to be
  correct. }
\tiny \2 {\tiny Many applications are loosely synchronous, so impact
  of solving this is high.}

\tiny \1 { \tiny Vivek worked on solving the problem for MPI+pthread
  reg. mesh code and CALU.  } 

\tiny \1 {\tiny He then worked on additional techniques such as
  weighted } 
\tiny \1 {\tiny With this, he was awarded a Lawrene Fellowship, where
  he worked on slack-conscious scheduling. } 

\tiny \1 {\tiny Recently, he returned to work with Simplice to show
  how combining scheduling techniques can be beneficial. This was
  published in SC} 

\tiny \1 {\tiny Conclusion  }

\tiny \2 {\tiny Critical problem currently, and fundamental to
  computer science.  Problem will remain as long we need supercomputing
  for advancements in science and engineering, and thus solution will
  still be relevant.} 

\tiny \2 {\tiny Already established strong contacts; benefit from
  Heidelberg through interactions contribute to discussions}
