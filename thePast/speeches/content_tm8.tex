\frametitle{What I learned}
% how much time you need for conclusion. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item I imagine many of you have had to go to a certain place thinking there's nothing there for me and I'm just coming in and going out. 
\item What I brought home from the experience is that you don't have
  to go to the big cities to have memorable times and find enjoyment.
\end{itemize}

% unremarkable places, especially if you go with family.
