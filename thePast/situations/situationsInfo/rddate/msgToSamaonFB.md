Hi Sama,


I'm writing to elaborate and add to my message on LinkedIn where I
asked if you want to catch up on Google Hangout. I haven't heard from
you and think you may not want to talk though you may be busy. 

I was thinking to send you an e-mail about this at
sshahahess@gmail.com that I have from you. I never had understood
whether that's a shared account since the name on the account said
Shreya Shahane rather than your name. I'm writing to you here. I'm
aware that you've deleted me but asssume that you don't mind me
writing to you here. I hope that you'll let me know if you're
interested in talking more at the end of this message.

I wrote to you on LinkedIn primarily because, after seeing you look me
up a few times on LinkedIn, I miss the days that you and I used
to talk on Skype in Sept to December 2012. I remember our
conversations because they were filled with laughter. I want to tell
you about that.

The other half of it is I've wondered about another person, specifically a cousin of
yours named Rucha, who I spoke to once in early 2013. I've been
wondering a bit about whether she is single. I'm wondering mainly how
she is doing. I want to find that out from you. 

I wrote the message to talk because I miss the days that we talked and
because I'm a bit curious about the
relationship status of someone else you know and mainly curious about
how they're doing. I'm wondering if you'd like to talk with me by
Google Hangouts given the reasons I've said in this message that
I want to talk to you.

Can you tell me that you understand that I truly miss talking with
you.
