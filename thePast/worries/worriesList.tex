\begin{document}

\underline{\textbf{Summary:}} This document summarizes worries
that are currently in existent,  or already past and resolved. 
Each event should have an approximate date. These
are drafts for those mapping to the actual calendar events. Within
the calendar event details/notes is where the ``pre-notes'' and
``post-notes'' go. Also, the WeekPlanDoc.tex file should have the worries
noted after these situations have been added. These situations should
be listed every week (and checked every night), so that pro-active
planning can take place.


% This list has the fairly big situations. Smaller situations go in the weekly doc; they could be integrated here too. ?


%TODO: 
%1. Be sure to apply the worklife cheat sheet here. 

%2. Add method to improve and learn from these situations. 

%3. Consider adding resolution.
