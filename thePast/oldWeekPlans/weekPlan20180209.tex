        OpenMP summary. \te{30 minutes} \pr{UI} \dl{Monday}

Hi Bill,

Iâ€™d like to let you know about a face-to-face meeting last week for
the OpenMP committee and a presentation of a substantiated proposal
for OpenMP and get your feedback on it. A substantiated version of the work on user-defined scheduling that
you and I co-authored at OpenMPCon was presented by a senior member of
the OpenMP committee, namely, Michael Klemm. My hope for the outcome
was that a first version would be added to the OpenMP 5.0
specification 

Here is the outcome of the presentation: 

The presentation has resulted in the proposed feature being created as
a ticket. 

The ticket unfortunately won't make it into the next release of OpenMP
5.0. This is understandably so, given that integratability with the
rest of OpenMP and its coverage of a variety of use cases needs to be
considered before it is added to OpenMP and fitting it in with the
several other tickets that need to be added by about September 2018 to
prepare OpenMP for release at SC 2018. 

A good result of the presentation at the face-to-face meeting is that
many people understood the idea, especially the definitions of the
user-defined loop schedulers that implement the loop schedules. Also, 
we've started to talk about actual ideas for reference implementation,
which will help to address problems of integration and also understand
how different designs for the interface and implementation perform on
hardware. I'm working with two people on the committee (Michael Klemm
along with Xinmin Tian, both from Intel) to develop a reference
implementation in OpenMP and the interface for it. Another point is
that we received good feedback from people on the Fortran subcommittee
after the presentation, supporting the feature for Fortran is something I had hand-waved in
thinking about while developing. The user-defined schedule relies on
passing to user-defined scheduler functions the pointers to objects
representing loop records for loop history. Passing pointers to
objects requires more thinking. 

While there, I also found several topics of interest, specifically,
interoperability with other runtimes systems, libraries. 

Being aware of the developing features should be useful for sucessful
integration of UDS in OpenMP. 

The affinity clause to be added to OpenMP 5.0 

My integration of the 

I met people from AMD and Intel. I didn't meet many people from IBM
for some reason. 

What you think about the results of the presentation? Do you think
that going to the 

 and if you have feedback
about them. 

Bronis: please let me know if I've said anything inaccurate based on
your understanding of the outcome of Michael's presentation last
Monday afternoon.

Hi, 

Yeah, the commercials were nice, especially the Alexa one and the Tide one
in my opinion.

Austin was good. People critical to
the application that I've submitted to Lawrence Livermore
Nat'l Lab were there and available to talk with me. 
During a group dinner last Thursday, I sat next to my former boss from LLNL and sat across from
important people from other national labs. I got an idea of where I stand in the application
process through conversations that night and the following day. 
It'll be a month or so before I go for an
on-site interview as I plan to give a job talk for the interview and
LLNL has to arrange for a seminar open to people at the Lab, 
and LLNL has to coordinate with other people that are applying for the
position. 


to know more information about where I'm at in the application
process and 

I'm also sending e-mails to people that I met at the forum besides my
former boss to tell points about my work that strengthen my
application.

        Dear Professor Gropp, 

        I hope that you are doing well. 

        You may remember that I applied once before as a PhD student
        for the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in 2015. Youâ€™d written a letter
        for an application to be invited to the program for me then. I
        attended an event for alumni of a HLF this past
        September. A person on the HLF's committee at the event
        encouraged me to apply again this year as a
        staff/postdoc for the HLF. I'd like to
        submit an application.

        I'd like to have you as one of my references for the
        application. The deadline for the letter is February 14,
        2018. I think that a reference from you will be
        helpful. My most recent resume is at \url{https://sites.google.com/site/vivek112/home/viveksfiles}. 
        Maybe I can give you text explaining the work that I've done since I
        started at my current position at University of Southern California/Information Sciences
        Institute. The website for the HLF is
        http://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/. Can you write a letter of reference for me for the
        application to the program this year?

        Iâ€™ve sent a request for the letter through the portal to apply for the
        program. Let me know if you can write the letter for me when
        you can.
