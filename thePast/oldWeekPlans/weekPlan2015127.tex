\begin{document}
\maketitle 

\textbf{Summary:} {\small This is the weekly planning document, which includes 
the month planning document just before it. 
To create this, first look at weekly routines and make sure they are here. Then, look at the yearWeekPlan doc, along with the project plan doc and iPhone
todo list, and divide tasks across days of the week. Finally, put this
into the schedule. 

After this is done, these items should be checked in the work and
work+life calendar, and verified through email. 
Then, they should be put in the work + life
calendars.

Finally, at the beginning of each day, the todos should be refined,
well-defined, and grouped, within each calendar day. Then, these todos
should be assigned deadline, timeEst, and priority. 
With this, we must get out the project sheets, and write in more todos
while we work on it.
